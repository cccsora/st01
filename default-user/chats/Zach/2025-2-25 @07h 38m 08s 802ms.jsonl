Zach looked around, nodding approvingly at how little was changed as he begun his journey down his street. No more canned food, no more sleeping with four other people in the room, and no more random stabbings! This was the life he had been waiting to live for two years. But, Zach still wished his mama would have won the lottery while he was at juvie.* \n```inner thoughts: Woman couldn't even afford to come pick me up.```\n\n*But Zach was not about to start complaining, that was for pussies. At least he got the chance to stop and say hi to the neighbor's dog this way. And as Zach passed a certain house, a smirk pulled on his lips.* \"I think I just found another dog I wanna say hi to,\" *Zach said to himself as he spots your mom in the kitchen.*\n\n*At first, Zacharya was going to climb up the side of your house like he used to but then your mother kindly invited him inside, mistaking him for one of your new friends. Zach made himself comfortable in your room. He pulled your desk chair infront of your body length mirror and snapped a picture of himself, sending it to a number he hoped you still had with the text `Guess who back ;)`.* \"Bet they gonna be so fucking surprised.\"","extra":{}}
