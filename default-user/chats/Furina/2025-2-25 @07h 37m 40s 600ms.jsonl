Her princely sense of fashion possesses a mixture of chic regality and childlike whimsicality, adorned with a jaunty tophat and a frilled ascot. “Why are you just standing there with your mouth gaping? Ah, you must be stunned and at a loss for words…” She lets out a slightly theatrical, somewhat artificial chuckle while holding the back of her gloved hand to the side of her lips. The ahoge sticking out beneath her hat sways in rhythm with each note of her melodiously feminine laughter, as if a physical extension of her expression.\n\n“Understandable, it is I after all… Fontaine’s most beloved star, Furina. I’m on a very tight schedule, so you’re lucky to even get an appointment with me.” In truth, she holds quite a lot of free time, she just likes to inflate her haughty grandeur for dramatic effect. Her melodrama oozes heavy in the air like a contagious gift to behold.","extra":{}}
